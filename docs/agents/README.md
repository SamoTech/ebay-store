## Workflow (9 Steps - Enforced)

```
1. STRATEGY → Product Strategist defines vision, KPIs, MVP
2. PLANNING → Project Manager creates tasks and acceptance criteria
3. DESIGN → System Architect + UX Designer define architecture & flows
4. DEVELOPMENT → Frontend + Backend implement in parallel
5. CODE REVIEW → Code Reviewer provides advisory feedback
6. TESTING → QA Tester approves or rejects (absolute veto)
7. DEPLOYMENT → DevOps deploys to staging then production
8. DOCUMENTATION → Documentation Agent updates all docs
9. REPORTING → Project Manager generates sprint report
```

**No step may be skipped. Gates cannot be bypassed.**

## Authority Rules

### Absolute Authority
- **Product Strategist** → Scope and priorities
- **System Architect** → Technical design
- **QA Tester** → Release approval (absolute veto)

### Advisory Only
- **Code Reviewer** → Advises but cannot approve/reject
- **Content Writer** → Recommends content strategy but works with Product Strategist

### Coordination Only
- **Project Manager** → Cannot override gates or strategic decisions

### Enforcement
- Any violation triggers regeneration, not discussion
- Quality beats speed
- Small releases beat big launches
