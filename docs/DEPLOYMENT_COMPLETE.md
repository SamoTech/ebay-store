  ↓
Homepage displays products with "Live eBay catalog active" badge
```

### Category Page Flow

```
User clicks category (e.g., Electronics)

Category page fetches from /api/products/category/electronics

Category page displays with "Live eBay products" badge
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Products Not Showing

**Symptom:** Homepage or categories show static products instead of live

**Check:**
1. Visit `/api/ebay-status` → Should show `"mode": "client_credentials"`
2. Visit `/api/ebay-test` → Should show `"success": true`
3. Check Vercel logs for API errors

**Solution:**
- Verify environment variables in Vercel
- Ensure Production keys (not Sandbox)
- Redeploy if recently added credentials

### No Clicks in EPN Dashboard

**Wait Period:** 24-48 hours for data to appear

**Verify:**
1. Click a product on your site
2. Check URL contains `campid=5338903178`
3. Ensure Campaign is active in EPN

### Slow Page Load

**Normal:** First load after 1 hour may take 2-3 seconds (fetching from eBay)
**Fast:** Subsequent loads served from cache (< 500ms)

**Optimize:**
- API responses cached for 1 hour
- Consider reducing products per category if needed
- Static fallback always available
